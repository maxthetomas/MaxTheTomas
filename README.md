I don't know what to write here.

Sometimes I do random stuff on the internet, be it a random small joke website, like [voiceaitor.pro](https://voiceaitor.pro), or somewhat big game projects, or game mods, or something else.. I usually don't remember what I make..

Somehow [one of my random projects](https://modrinth.com/mod/skip-backup-screen) got 180k downloads on Modrinth. Crazy, right? 

Ight, I don't have anything else to say.
