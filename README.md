# Uh, hello, hello? Is anybody there?

If you are reading this I'm probably ~~dead~~ working on something cool right now. Well, if you are here, you can ask me to open up ONE of my private repositories, so you can say "oh, his code sucks!"

So, about me... I'm mostly frontend and backend JS developer. I also know C#, Java, Kotlin,... uh.. what else?.., a bit of C++. I wanna learn TypeScript, Rust and Go (seems like a cool language, tbh). At the sime time I like doing some cool UI/UX stuff, you really need to think while doing it. So, recently I started to screw around in Figma to create some interesting user interfaces. I'm doing quite well.

Sometimes I do weird projects. For example, some time ago I tried to create AI to play that weird *sudoku with blocks game*..? You can find it [here](https://github.com/maxthetomas/Sudoku-Blocks). Also, we (myself and my friend [Kitakot](https://github.com/kitakot)) sometimes do some games, you can find them on my ["game studio" website](https://games.maxthetomas.ru/). *whispers: we are doing a game right now, and hopefully are going to release it soon.*

Here is the link to my website: https://maxthetomas.ru/ - you can find all the other links there. 

And also, *pleeease don't judge my commit names* :)
